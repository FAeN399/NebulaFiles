# Complete Hilt Build Error Solution

## Root Cause Analysis

The `error.NonExistentClass` was caused by a **double-binding conflict** in the dependency injection setup:

1. **Classes with `@Inject constructor()` were also being provided via `@Provides` methods**
   - This created ambiguous bindings that Hilt couldn't resolve
   - KSP failed to generate proper components due to this conflict

2. **WorkManager initialization conflict**
   - The manifest had `tools:replace` instead of `tools:node="remove"`
   - This caused manifest merger warnings that cascaded into Hilt processing

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Removed Redundant Provider Methods
```kotlin
// BEFORE - Double binding
@Provides
@Singleton
fun provideFileOperationRepository(): FileOperationRepository = FileOperationRepository()

// AFTER - Let @Inject constructor handle it
// (Method removed entirely)
```

Classes with `@Inject constructor()` and `@Singleton` don't need explicit `@Provides` methods.

### 2. Fixed WorkManager Manifest Declaration
```xml
<!-- BEFORE -->
<provider
    android:name="androidx.work.impl.WorkManagerInitializer"
    tools:replace="android:authorities" />

<!-- AFTER -->
<provider
    android:name="androidx.work.impl.WorkManagerInitializer"
    tools:node="remove" />
```

Using `tools:node="remove"` properly removes the default initializer instead of trying to replace attributes.

### 3. Simplified Module Structure
The AppModule now only contains a comment explaining that repositories use constructor injection. This prevents confusion and accidental double-bindings.

## Why This Works

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each dependency has exactly one way to be provided
2. **Proper Manifest Merging**: WorkManager's default initializer is cleanly removed
3. **Clear Initialization Order**: No conflicts between manual and automatic initialization

## Verification Steps

1. The build should now complete without Hilt processing errors
2. No more `error.NonExistentClass` messages
3. WorkManager warning should be resolved
4. All dependency injections should work properly

## Prevention Guidelines

1. **Never use `@Provides` for classes that have `@Inject constructor()`**
2. **Always use `tools:node="remove"` for provider removal, not `tools:replace`**
3. **Keep Hilt modules minimal - only for external dependencies**
4. **Verify manifest merger output when using WorkManager with Hilt**

## Build Commands

```bash
# Clean build to ensure fresh start
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug

# If issues persist, clear all caches
rm -rf .gradle build app/build
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-build-cache
```
