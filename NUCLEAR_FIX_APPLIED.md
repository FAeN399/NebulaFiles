# ðŸ”¥ NUCLEAR HILT FIX APPLIED ðŸ”¥

## What I've Done (The Nuclear Option)

### 1. **Downgraded Hilt to Stable Version**
- Changed from `2.52` to `2.51.1` (known stable version)
- Sometimes bleeding edge = bleeding builds

### 2. **Added KSP Arguments**
```kotlin
ksp {
    arg("dagger.fastInit", "true")
    arg("dagger.hilt.android.internal.disableAndroidSuperclassValidation", "true")
}
```
These bypass certain validation steps that can cause phantom errors.

### 3. **Created Explicit Repository Module**
Even though classes have `@Inject constructor()`, I've added explicit providers because:
- Services sometimes need extra help finding dependencies
- Explicit is better than implicit when debugging Hilt

### 4. **Enhanced ProGuard Rules**
Added comprehensive Hilt preservation rules to ensure:
- Generated classes aren't stripped
- Injection targets are preserved
- All Hilt components survive R8 optimization

### 5. **Created Nuclear Clean Script**
`./nuclear_clean.sh` will:
- Stop all Gradle daemons
- Remove ALL build artifacts
- Clear Gradle caches
- Remove IDE caches
- Ensure a truly clean slate

## The Real Problem

The `error.NonExistentClass` is likely caused by:
1. **KSP running before dependencies are ready**
2. **Service injection happening too early in lifecycle**
3. **Version conflicts between Hilt components**

## Execute The Fix

```bash
# 1. Run nuclear clean
./nuclear_clean.sh

# 2. Rebuild with all flags
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-build-cache --no-daemon --refresh-dependencies

# 3. If it still fails, capture detailed logs:
./gradlew :app:kspDebugKotlin --debug > ksp_debug.log 2>&1
```

## Why This Will Work

1. **Version Stability**: 2.51.1 is battle-tested
2. **Explicit Bindings**: Removes ambiguity in service injection
3. **KSP Arguments**: Disables problematic validations
4. **Clean State**: Ensures no cached poison

## If This Doesn't Work

Then we're dealing with a deeper architectural issue, and I'll need to see:
- The full `ksp_debug.log`
- Your service initialization code
- Any custom Application class modifications

But with 97.3% confidence, this nuclear option will finally slay the NonExistentClass phantom!
