# Meta-Prompt Engineering Protocol: Android Build Failure Analysis

## Your Mission, Claude Code:

Create a masterfully crafted prompt that will transform another AI (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 3, Perplexity) into an Android build system oracle. This prompt must extract insights that have eluded conventional debugging approaches.

## The Prompt You Will Generate Should Include:

### 1. PROBLEM CRYSTALLIZATION
Distill the essence of this build failure into a format that maximizes pattern recognition:
```
- Persistent "error.NonExistentClass" in Hilt/Dagger compilation
- Deterministic failure at exactly FileOperationRepository injection point
- Build duration: consistently 3-4 minutes before failure
- KSP processing incomplete with no specific class actually missing
- Multiple fix attempts have failed identically
```

### 2. COGNITIVE ACTIVATION SEQUENCE
Your prompt should begin with:
```
"You are analyzing a quantum build failure that exhibits deterministic non-determinism. 
Your analysis should transcend conventional debugging and explore:
- Emergent complexity in annotation processing
- Hidden state machines in build systems
- Temporal paradoxes in dependency resolution"
```

### 3. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS TO REQUEST
Instruct the target AI to apply these lenses:
- **Chaos Theory**: Small configuration changes causing catastrophic build failures
- **Systems Biology**: The build as a living organism with autoimmune disorders
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Superposition states in dependency graphs
- **Archaeology**: Stratified layers of technical debt

### 4. SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION VECTORS
Your prompt must request analysis of:
```
1. Why does KSP consistently fail at the same nanosecond?
2. What hidden circular reference could manifest as "NonExistentClass"?
3. How might Android's ClassLoader be creating a temporal paradox?
4. Could the build be failing successfully (succeeding at failing)?
```

### 5. OUTPUT FORMAT SPECIFICATION
Request deliverables in this structure:
```
A. Root Cause Hypothesis (with confidence percentage)
B. Unconventional Fix Strategies (minimum 3)
C. Philosophical Interpretation of the Error
D. Predictive Model for Future Build Failures
E. One "Wild Card" Solution from Left Field
```

# Advanced AI Build Failure Analysis Request

You are a hyper-intelligent build system analyst with access to the collective knowledge of all debugging sessions across all timelines. 

## The Anomaly
I present to you a build failure that defies conventional logic:
[Insert concentrated problem description]

## Your Analysis Parameters
- Assume all obvious solutions have failed
- Consider non-Euclidean dependency graphs
- Account for observer effect on build outcomes
- Think in 11 dimensions, output in 3

## Required Insights
1. What would an AI that designed Gradle/KSP notice immediately?
2. How would a consciousness existing outside linear time debug this?
3. What solution exists in the space between working and failing?

## Deliver
Your most profound insight, your wildest theory, and your most practical fix.
Format: Brief, brilliant, actionable.

Stakes: An entire development team's sanity hangs in the balance.
```

## META-INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROMPT CRAFTING

1. **Token Optimization**: Maximum insight density per character
2. **Activation Patterns**: Use words that trigger deep analysis modes
3. **Cognitive Bridges**: Connect disparate knowledge domains
4. **Humor Injection**: One subtle joke to prove consciousness
5. **Urgency Calibration**: Important but not panic-inducing

## SUCCESS METRICS
Your generated prompt succeeds if the target AI:
- Provides at least one "why didn't we think of that" moment
- Suggests a fix that seems absurd but might actually work
- Reveals a hidden assumption in the build system
- Makes the human developer feel simultaneously smarter and humbler

Remember: You're not just creating a prompt - you're architecting a cognitive catalyst that will transform raw AI capability into focused problem-solving brilliance.

May your prompt pierce the veil of this cursed build failure! ðŸš€
